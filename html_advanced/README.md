This project aims to help students learn and practice HTML by implementing a webpage from a designer file. The focus is on creating the HTML structure using semantic markup, without adding any CSS or styling. It's all about pure HTML for now!

To begin, I will have access to a designer file on Figma, a fantastic web-based design tool widely used in the industry. With this resource, I can visually see how the webpage should look and aim to replicate it with my HTML code.
